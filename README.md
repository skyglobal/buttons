========================

> A collection of brand approved buttons for use across Sky.com

## Usage

### Complete toolkit from a CDN

The easiest way to use web toolkit is to refer to the compiled, cached JS and CSS combined with the rest of the toolkit directly from your page.

Visit the [web toolkit homepage](http://skyglobal.github.io/web-toolkit).


### Included as a SASS module in your own application

Alternatively, you may not wish to use the whole toolkit and instead include this component in your application's source code.


## Contribution
